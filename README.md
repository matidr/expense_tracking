# ðŸ’° Expense Tracker App â€“ My Third Flutter Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is an **Expense Tracker** application built with the **Flutter** framework. As my **third Flutter app**, the project aims to explore more interactive aspects of Flutter development â€” including **dialogs, modals, form input, validation**, and **theme customization**.

The goal is to deepen my understanding of building real-world, interactive mobile apps using Flutterâ€™s robust widget system and state management techniques.

## ðŸ›  What I Practiced

This project helped me expand my Flutter knowledge with more advanced UI/UX concepts:

- Implementing **modal bottom sheets** and **alert dialogs** for smooth user flows.
- Collecting user input through **TextFormField** and validating data before submission.
- Structuring and styling interactive forms.
- Managing state dynamically when adding or removing expenses.
- Configuring and applying custom **app themes** with `ThemeData`.
- Learning how to build a more **responsive layout** and widget hierarchy.

This app marks a key step forward in building fully interactive apps with **user-driven data**, and brings me closer to developing production-ready Flutter experiences.
